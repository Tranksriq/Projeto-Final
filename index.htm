            <div class="body-text">
                <p>At dusk on December 1, 1955, Parks boarded a bus on Cleveland Avenue in downtown Montgomery. She paid her ticket and sat in the front row of seats reserved for blacks in the vehicle. </p>
                <p>The driver, James F. Blake, continued on his traditional route. The bus was filling up until at the third stop, in front of the Empire Theater, several passengers got on. Blake noticed that a couple of white people were standing. To solve the problem, he moved the sign from ‘’colored’’ (‘’person of color’’, a term used in the United States to refer to African Americans) to behind the row where Parks was standing. </p>
                <p>He demanded that the seated black passengers stand up so that the whites could sit. While the other three blacks rose, Rosa refused. Years later, in an interview, she recalled: ‘’my body was seized by determination, like a quilt on a cold night.’’</p>
                <p>Parks moved, but to the window seat. Blake, the driver, asked her, ‘’Why don't you get up?’’ She replied that:</p>
                <p>“i shouldn’t have to get up”</p>
                <p>The man then called the police and had Rosa Parks arrested. When the policeman arrived she asked “Why do you mess with us like that?” He replied, “I don't know, but the law is the law and you are under arrest.”</p>
